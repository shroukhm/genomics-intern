**Overview**

This two projects focuses on genomics analysis in the field of cancer research (1 prostate cancer, 1 breast cancer ). It involves the comparison of gene expression levels between a control group (normal) and a tumor group. The project includes preprocessing . Statistical analysis and differential gene expression analysis  with deseq2  are performed to gain insights into the differences between the two groups. The project also involves visualizing the data in various ways to facilitate data exploration and interpretation.

**Data**

The project 1 utilizes genomics data obtained from the normal and tumor groups for Prostate Adenocarcinoma. The data includes measurements of genes expression levels for multiple samples in each group.
The project 2 utilizes genomics data obtained from the normal and tumor groups for breast cancer. The data includes measurements of genes expression levels for multiple samples in each group.

**Statistical Analysis**

Statistical analysis bu using deseq2 is carried out to identify significant differences in genes expression between the normal and tumor groups. This analysis helps in identifying genes that are differentially expressed .
